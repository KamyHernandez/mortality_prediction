Description
=============

In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict mortality in patients with heart failure admitted to ICU. The data for training and testing the model will be extracted from MIMIC-III database, and as programming languages, Python and R will be considered.

Requirements
=============

- To load MIMIC III database in Azure Database.
- To make the connection between R studio and Azure Database.
- To define target cohort and outcome.
- To extract the relevant features.
- To define the machine learning algorithm's architecture.
- To train the model with the extracted features.
